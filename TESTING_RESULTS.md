# Testing Results: Multiple IPs and MACs Support

## Test Summary

All tests passed successfully! ✅

## Tests Performed

### 1. Database Schema Tests
- ✅ Created new schema with auto-increment PK
- ✅ Added UNIQUE constraint on (container_id, network_name)
- ✅ Verified column order and data types

### 2. Multi-Network Insert Tests
- ✅ Inserted container with 3 network interfaces
- ✅ Each interface stored in separate row
- ✅ All IPs and MACs preserved correctly

### 3. ON CONFLICT Tests
- ✅ Attempted duplicate insert (correctly failed)
- ✅ UPDATE via ON CONFLICT works
- ✅ IP and MAC updated on network re-scan

### 4. Cleanup Tests
- ✅ DELETE removes all interfaces for removed container
- ✅ Container-specific cleanup preserves other containers
- ✅ Network count verified after cleanup

### 5. Go Code Tests
- ✅ Compiled successfully
- ✅ Schema generation works
- ✅ Docker scan logic updated correctly

### 6. React UI Tests
- ✅ Built successfully
- ✅ normalizeRow handles new column indices
- ✅ Row keys use container_id + network for uniqueness

### 7. Integration Tests
- ✅ Full workflow: init → scan → update → cleanup
- ✅ API response format verified
- ✅ Multiple networks displayed as separate rows

## Sample Data

### Example: Container with 3 Networks

Container `web123` (nginx-prod) appears as 3 rows:

| ID | Container ID | IP            | MAC               | Network  |
|----|------------- |---------------|-------------------|----------|
| 1  | web123       | 172.17.0.5    | 02:42:ac:11:00:05 | bridge   |
| 2  | web123       | 192.168.50.10 | 02:42:c0:a8:32:0a | frontend |
| 3  | web123       | 10.10.0.20    | 02:42:0a:0a:00:14 | backend  |

## Changes Made

1. **Database Schema** (`config/atlas_go/internal/db/setup.go` & `config/scripts/atlas_db_setup.sh`)
   - Changed PK from TEXT to auto-increment INTEGER
   - Added `container_id` column
   - Added UNIQUE constraint on (container_id, network_name)

2. **Go Code** (`config/atlas_go/internal/scan/docker_scan.go`)
   - Updated INSERT to use `container_id` column
   - Changed ON CONFLICT to handle (container_id, network_name)
   - Updated cleanup to use `container_id` field

3. **React UI** (`data/react-ui/src/components/HostsTable.jsx`)
   - Updated `normalizeRow` to handle different column indices for docker vs hosts
   - Changed row key generation to use container_id + network
   - Each network interface now displays as separate row

4. **Documentation**
   - Created MIGRATION_GUIDE.md with upgrade instructions
   - Updated README.md to highlight multi-network support
   - Added testing documentation

## Deployment Readiness

The changes are **production-ready**:
- ✅ All code compiles
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ UI builds successfully
- ✅ Docker build ready
- ✅ Migration guide provided
- ✅ Backward compatibility noted

## Migration Path

Users upgrading from previous versions can:
1. **Fresh install**: Just pull the new image (recommended)
2. **Manual migration**: Follow MIGRATION_GUIDE.md to preserve data

## Performance Impact

- ✅ No performance degradation expected
- ✅ Queries remain fast (indexed on container_id)
- ✅ UI handles additional rows efficiently
- ℹ️ Storage increases linearly with number of networks per container

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to production
2. Monitor for any edge cases
3. Collect user feedback
4. Consider future enhancements (e.g., network topology visualization)
